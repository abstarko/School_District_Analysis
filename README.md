# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

We were given data to analyze of students in multiple schools. Using Python and Pandas I was able to collect the student data into a DataFrame and prepare a cleaned version of the Dataframe. I summarized key pieces of the data, while drilling down into the data to analyze specific subsets. From there I was able to compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions, in which I was able to analyze the final results.

Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12, Python 3.9.13, Pandas 1.4.4

## Summary

When looking at our analysis we can see that Public schools are given a larger budget compared to Charter schools. This doesn't seem to affect the math scores for these schools, as Public schools tend to have lower scores. I would be curious to see how this budget is allocated. Overall Charter schools tend to have higher scores in both math and reading. We could look at other subjects such as science and history and see where the schools lie and if Charter schools have overall higher grades in all subjects.
